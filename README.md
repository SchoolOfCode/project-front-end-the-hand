## The Hand - School of Code

Thanks for taking a look at The Hand's first project, Bookavo. Bookavo is an app that allows restaurants to manage their bookings whilst also providing them with an easy to use platform to drive footfall from local customers.

## Prompt 

Our final project for School of Code involved creating a full-stack application in two weeks. Our prompt was to "create an application that will help businesses manage their bookings following their reopening post-pandemic". 

## How To Run Our App

![landing page](http://url/to/img.png)

Firstly, you should run our backend 
'' dotnet watch run

Following this you should run our frontend 
'' npm i
''npm start 

Or, alternatively visit the link to our app here https://bookavo.netlify.app

To use the restaurant login, and see what our restaurants would see;
Restaurant Name       	   Email	             Password
				
Adrian's Dining  	info@adriansdining.com    	bookavo1234!	
Friendly Fire	    manager@friendlyfire.com	bookavo1234!	
Bayt Al Yemani	    bayt@alyemani.com	        bookavo1234!	
Five Rivers	        fiverivers@fiverivers.com	bookavo1234!

## Contributions

As this project is a work in progress, you can expect to see regular changes. The Hand will continue to work on this project as we develop our skills, and as we decide where Bookavo could improve.

## Thanks!

For our team, this project is the culmination of the School of Code Bootcamp, and represents the sum of our collective learnings over the past 13 weeks. Thanks to everyone that helped us out along our first steps in to coding.
